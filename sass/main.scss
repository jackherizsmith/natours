// import all partial files This architecture is especially important on large projects
// eventually main.scss will only be our imported code - nothing else will be here
// where code goes is subjective and is mainly so you can find it - go with your gut.
// different parts of a class can go in different places, e.g. body is split between base and typography

// _ in filename implies it's only partial

@import "abstracts/functions";
@import "abstracts/mixins";
@import "abstracts/variables"; // where we define our variable for use across the project

@import "base/animations";
@import "base/base"; // base for low level basics: resets, html style and body selectors
@import "base/typography";
@import "base/utilities"; // for generic reuseable snippets (e.g. centre text)

@import "components/button"; // re-useable building blocks that can be used anywhere in our project
@import "components/composition";
@import "components/feature-box"; // always remember to import new files!
@import "components/card";
@import "components/story";
@import "components/bg-video";

@import "layout/header"; // layouts is what hold our components together
@import "layout/grid-test"; // learning float for grid layout

@import "pages/home"    // for styles that only apply for particular pages
